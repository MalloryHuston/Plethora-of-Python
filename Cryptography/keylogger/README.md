# How to Make a Keylogger

``keyboard`` is the *ultimate* Python library for capturing keyboard inputs â€“ one of the coolest uses of this is making keyloggers.

## Modules Needed

```bash
pip install keyboard
```

(Use ``pip3`` if needed)

## How to Run the Script

Because ``keyboard`` needs access to low-level events, ***you must run with ``sudo``***:

```bash
sudo python3 keylogger.py
```
